[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) is large library used everywhere in scientific
computing. That's why breaking backwards-compatibility comes as a significant cost and
is almost always avoided, even if the API of some methods is arguably lacking. This
package provides drop-in wrappers "fixing" those.

[npx](https://github.com/nschloe/npx) does the same for [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).

If you have a fix for a SciPy method that can't go upstream for some reason, feel free
to PR here.

#### Krylov methods
```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.sparse
import scipyx as spx

# create tridiagonal (-1, 2, -1) matrix
n = 100
data = -np.ones((3, n))
data[1] = 2.0
A = scipy.sparse.spdiags(data, [-1, 0, 1], n, n)
A = A.tocsr()
b = np.ones(n)


sol, info = spx.cg(A, b, tol=1.0e-10)
sol, info = spx.minres(A, b, tol=1.0e-10)
sol, info = spx.gmres(A, b, tol=1.0e-10)
sol, info = spx.bicg(A, b, tol=1.0e-10)
sol, info = spx.bicgstab(A, b, tol=1.0e-10)
sol, info = spx.cgs(A, b, tol=1.0e-10)
sol, info = spx.qmr(A, b, tol=1.0e-10)
```
`sol` is the solution of the linear system `A @ x = b` (or `None` if no convergence),
and `info` contains some useful data, e.g., `info.resnorms`. The solution `sol` and all
callback `x` have the shape of `x0`/`b`.
The methods are wrappers around [SciPy's iterative
solvers](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.linalg.html).

Relevant issues:
 * [inconsistent number of callback calls between cg, minres](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/13936)


#### Optimization
```python
import scipyx as spx


def f(x):
    return (x ** 2 - 2) ** 2


x0 = 1.5
out = spx.minimize(f, x0)
print(out.x)

x0 = -3.2
x, _ = spx.leastsq(f, x0)
print(x)
```
In scipyx, all intermediate values `x` and the result from a minimization `out.x` will
have the same shape as `x0`. (In SciPy, they always have shape `(n,)`, no matter the
input vector.)

Relevant issues:

 * [optimization: let out.x have the same shape as
   x0](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/13869)


#### Root-finding
```python
import scipyx as spx


def f(x):
    return x ** 2 - 2


a, b = spx.bisect(f, 0.0, 5.0, tol=1.0e-12)
a, b = spx.regula_falsi(f, 0.0, 5.0, tol=1.0e-12)
```
scipyx provides some basic nonlinear root-findings algorithms:
[bisection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method) and [regula
falsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regula_falsi). They're not as fast-converging as
[other methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method), but are very robust
and work with almost any function.
